# CustomMobsGIT
CustomMobsGIT contains all the source code for the Custom Mobs videos

The codes in this repository includes all the Custom Mobs coded in the Custom Mobs series. Codes for the Custom Items are not included here. Instead, they can be found in the CustomItemsGIT repository

Codes in this repository may be different from the ones in the videos. This might be because either there is a shorter way to code the item as compared to the codes in the videos, or a necessary feature was missed out in the video.

Thank you for your understanding and have a great day! Enjoy Coding!
